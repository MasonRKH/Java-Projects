# Java-Projects
This does not represent a complete collection of my works, nor do I consider it finished in its current state. The contents of this repository are 
updated regularly and new projects will continuously be added.

As always, any and all criticisms are appreciated. However, many of these programs will be left flawed and inefficient, in an effort to display my 
growth as a student, and a fledgling programmer.
